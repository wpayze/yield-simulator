# Yield Simulator
This simulator will allow users to calculate the potential financial returns on a property investment. The simulator requires the following input data:

- Purchase price of the property: The total cost of acquiring the property.
- Monthly rent amount: The rental income generated from the property on a monthly basis.
- Annual rental fee: The percentage of the annual rent that is considered as the agency fee.
- Agency fees on the rent: The agency fees charged on the rental income, with different rates applied over the years. The first year has a fee of 30%, the second year has a fee of 25%, and subsequent years have a fee of 20%.

The objective is to develop a prototype web interface that allows users to input the necessary data and obtain calculations for the monthly net income and the return on investment for the first three years.
